            <h3>What is in a name?</h3>

            <p>I recently worked at The Open Golf event where every guest I had a conversation with asked me what I do when I'm not a gorgeous waitress... *smirk* </p>

            <p>And when I mentioned that I study Forensic Anthropology (FA), the reaction was almost predictable... 'WOW! *short uncomfortable moment of silence as hand shake continues* What is that?'.</p>

            <p>Now, these guys not knowing what on earth Forensic Anthropology is, is not a question of intellect. It's just not as common as engineering or medicine or social work (just picking these randomly). If I told you I was a teacher, you'd ask me what subject I taught. If I told you I was a pilot, you'd know, or at least assume, I flew an aircraft of some kind. Yet, very few have a vague idea, and one or two know exactly what FA is, and it's usually because they've either read Kathy Reichs' novels or watched the show 'Bones' (which is loosely based on Dr Reichs' novels, starring Emily Deschanel and David Boreanaz). I binge watched Bones the summer before I moved to do my Bachelor's degree. That may have just a little to do with why I've chosen to study Forensic Anthropology.</p>
            <h3 class="section-heading">So what is Forensic Anthropology?</h2>

            <p>The word 'Anthropology' itself can be used to describe many areas of studies. It can be used to describe the study of the different aspects of humans. What matters most is the prefix. For example, Cultural, linguistic, social, forensic, etc.</p>

            <p>'Anthropo-', from the Greek word 'anthrōpos ' (Oxford Dictionary), means Human Being. So Anthropology, as I understand, is simply the study of human beings. In the case of Forensic Anthropology, it is the study of humans who once were, merely because of the forensic aspect. So forensic anthropologists study human skeletal remains for identification purposes. I.e to identify age, sex, ancestry, etc. Bones can reveal quite a few things about an individual you know. Sometimes, they can even reveal how they died.</p>

            <p>I don't wanna lose you to a tonne of information at this point. In these blogs, I will explore each of those. Well, give it my best attempt anyway.</p>

            <p>I hope this provides a certain level of clarity as to what forensic anthropologists do. I am yet to explore this area of study in great depth. I will also be talking about my master's thesis. So if you want to know more, stay tuned!</p>
